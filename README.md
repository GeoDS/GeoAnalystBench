GeoAnalystBench: A GeoAI benchmark for assessing large language models for spatial analysis workflow and code generation

## Automating GIS Workflows with Large Language Models (LLMs)


Recent advances in Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) have been driven by generative AI and foundation models. While powerful geoprocessing tools are widely available in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), automating these workflows using AI-driven Python scripting remains a challenge, especially for non-expert users.

This project explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, and DeepSeek in automating GIS workflows. We introduce a benchmark of 50 geoprocessing tasks to evaluate these models' ability to generate Python functions from natural language instructions.

Our findings reveal that proprietary LLMs achieve higher success rates (>90%) and produce workflows more aligned with human-designed implementations than open-source models. The results suggest that integrating proprietary LLMs with ArcPy is a more effective approach for specialized GIS workflows.

By providing benchmarks and insights, this study contributes to the development of optimized prompting strategies, future GIS automation tools, and hybrid GeoAI workflows that combine LLMs with human expertise.

## Key Features:
- **Benchmark for GIS Automation**: Evaluation of LLMs on 50 geoprocessing tasks.
- **LLM Performance Comparison**: Validity and similarity analysis of generated workflows.
- **Open-source Versus Proprietary Models**: Comparison of performance and reliability.

## Dataset

This research developed 50 Python-based geoprocessing tasks derived
from GIS platforms, software, online tutorials, and academic literature. Each task comprises 3 to 10 subtasks, because
the simplest task still involves data loading, applying at least one spatial analysis tool, and saving the final outputs. The
list of those tasks with their sources are included in the [Tasks](#tasks) section below.

The dataset includes the following information:
| Key Column                | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| ID                        | Unique identifier for each task |
| Open or Closed Source     | Use open source or closed source library |
| Task                      | Brief description of the task |
| Instruction               | Natural language instruction for completing the task |
| Domain Knowledge          | Domain-specific knowledge related to task |
| Dataset Description       | Data name, format, descriptions, and key columns |
| Human Designed Workflow   | Numbered list of human-designed workflow |
| Task Length               | The length of the human-designed workflow |
| Code                      | Human-designed code for the task and dataset |

The dataset is avaliable to download at [GeoAnalystBench](https://github.com/GeoDS/GeoAnalystBench/blob/master/dataset/GeoAnalystBench.csv).

The data being used in this research is avaliable to download at (tbd).

## Tasks
There are 50 tasks in the dataset, and this section covers all tasks and their sources. For more details, please refer to the [GeoAnalystBench](https://github.com/GeoDS/GeoAnalystBench/blob/master/dataset/GeoAnalystBench.csv).

Note that there are tasks with the same name but different id. This typically happens when the task is slightly different, or the task is a subset of a larger task.
