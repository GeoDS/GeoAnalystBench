GeoAnalystBench: A GeoAI benchmark for assessing large language models for spatial analysis workflow and code generation

## Automating GIS Workflows with Large Language Models (LLMs)


Recent advances in Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) have been driven by generative AI and foundation models. While powerful geoprocessing tools are widely available in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), automating these workflows using AI-driven Python scripting remains a challenge, especially for non-expert users.

This project explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, and DeepSeek in automating GIS workflows. We introduce a benchmark of 50 geoprocessing tasks to evaluate these models' ability to generate Python functions from natural language instructions.

Our findings reveal that proprietary LLMs achieve higher success rates (>90%) and produce workflows more aligned with human-designed implementations than open-source models. The results suggest that integrating proprietary LLMs with ArcPy is a more effective approach for specialized GIS workflows.

By providing benchmarks and insights, this study contributes to the development of optimized prompting strategies, future GIS automation tools, and hybrid GeoAI workflows that combine LLMs with human expertise.

## Key Features:
- **Benchmark for GIS Automation**: Evaluation of LLMs on 50 geoprocessing tasks.
- **LLM Performance Comparison**: Validity and similarity analysis of generated workflows.
- **Open-source Versus Proprietary Models**: Comparison of performance and reliability.

## Dataset

This research developed 50 Python-based geoprocessing tasks derived
from GIS platforms, software, online tutorials, and academic literature. Each task comprises 3 to 10 subtasks, because
the simplest task still involves data loading, applying at least one spatial analysis tool, and saving the final outputs. The
list of those tasks with their sources are included in the [Tasks](#tasks) section below.

The dataset includes the following information:
| Key Column                | Description |

| Task                      | Brief description of the task |
| Instruction               | Natural language instruction for completing the task |
| Domain Knowledge          | Domain-specific knowledge related to task |
| Dataset Description       | Data name, format, descriptions, and key columns |
| Human Designed Workflow   | Numbered list of human-designed workflow |
| Task Length               | The length of the human-designed workflow |
| Code                      | Human-designed code for the task and dataset |

The dataset is avaliable to download at [GeoAnalystBench](https://github.com/GeoDS/GeoAnalystBench/blob/master/dataset/GeoAnalystBench.csv).

## Tasks
There are 50 tasks in the dataset, and this section covers all tasks and their sources. For more details, please refer to the [GeoAnalystBench](https://github.com/GeoDS/GeoAnalystBench/blob/master/dataset/GeoAnalystBench.csv).

## Case Study 1(Task 43): Identification of Home Range and Spatial Clusters from Animal
Movements
Understanding elk movement patterns is critical for wildlife conservation and management in the field of animal ecology. The task needs to identify elk home ranges in Southwestern Alberta, 2009 using GPS-tracking locations. In doing so, researchers are able to analyze their space use and movement clusters for elk populations. Understanding the home range of the elk population is essential for ensuring sustainability and stability of the wildlife.

> The analysis will generate spatial outputs stored in ""dataset/elk_home_range.gdb"" and ""dataset/"".
>
> [Domain Knowledge]:
> ""Home range"" can be defined as the area within which an animal normally lives and finds what it needs
> for survival. Basically, the home range is the area that an animal travels for its normal daily activities.
> ""Minimum Bounding Geometry"" creates a feature class containing polygons which represent a specified
> minimum bounding geometry enclosing each input feature or each group of input features. ""Convex
> hull"" is the smallest convex polygon that can enclose a group of objects, such as a group of points.
> ""Kernel Density Mapping"" calculates and visualizes features's density in a given area. ""DBSCAN"",
> Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise that cluster the points based on density
> criterion.

## Case Study 2
The second case study is about spatial hotspot analysis of car accidents. The Brevard County in Florida has one of the
deadliest interstate highways in the United States. This case study aims to identify the spatially distributed hot spots
along the road network. The dataset includes road network, crash locations from 2010 to 2015, and a network spatial
weighting matrix. Understanding the hot spots for car accidents is essential for the local transportation department
to make policies and quick responses for future accidents.
